If you are using it to store videos or audio, and you want to watch your videos or listen to your music directly from Google Drive it's not a good application for that.  It may work sometimes, but not all the time, as I found out.  Google tech support recommended that I store my videos on YouTube as private videos so that I can watch them whenever I wish.  But be aware that YouTube may change your uploaded video's codec and compression, meaning that the quality of your original video might be lost forever.  So I am uploading all of my videos to Google Drive to store them in their original format and quality, and then also uploading all of the videos to YouTube so that I can watch them from a storage location.  It's taking up double the storage space on Google servers since the videos are saved on both Google Drive and YouTube, but I guess that's not my problem.  If you are using it for Microsoft Document storage and want to edit you documents without downloading them to your computer, then Google Drive works okay for that.",3,126,2.19.252.05.45,2019-07-09 21:42:40,"Thanks for the feedback, Matthew.

I'm a fervient advocate of G.Drive over any other word processors, but I have to acknowledge that it is sometimes really hard to find the right folder or the right document, especially when you use it over the years. The fact that docs in a folder are ONLY arranged alphabetically doesn't help. We should have other variables, like date or importance. Apart from that, I think it would be helpful to have a ""pin it"" button for most important files in a folder. So there, have fun!",3,15,2.19.472.05.42,2020-01-15 15:13:02,"Hi, Lu.
