Another example is that when you delete something from your mobile device from YOUR computer it should delete it on the computer, right? Wrong.

Super app. With the new android version my folders were no longer synchronized between my android and the cloud and effectively made the app useless. This is the first time this happened to me in many years. I had to downgrade to an older version to make it work again. Took a long time to find out. Lost a lot of files in the process. This should not happen with a large company like Google. It seems many others are having the same problem.,1,0,2.19.472.05.40,2020-11-02 12:24:23,"Hi, Niels.

The Back Up Now button from Settings -> System -> Backup becomes inactive when you enable PIN/Fingerprint/Pattern on your phone. Also, the message above says ""waiting to back up..."". The second you disable that, the button becomes active again and can be used to make new backups. This is an issue starting with Android 9, still occurs with Android 10 (and probably 11, too). This also occurs with Pixel devices. Pretty much any Android device with Android 9 or newer, regardless of manufacturer. Please, fix this. I'd be happy to change my rating once you get this fixed. There are hundreds of people complaining about this. Still, nobody seems to care. You can just get an Android device with Android 9 or newer, enable PIN/Fingerprint/Pattern and check out that button.

I find no reason why anyone would want to give themselves headaches while producing no timely results after placing their personal or professional files into a vacuum. The world operates in real time in many ways thanks to the www, and internet speed is there for most people. So today I know of no one who finds convenience in and preference for doing a task on their list twice or multiple times, and no one would ever want to go through multiple processes just to be unsuccessful in the end with what they were trying to accomplish in terms of file storage, retrieval, or sharing of. We know this simply as waste of time, and that has precisely been my experience with Google Drive in recent time. Years ago, before intra-corporate hissy fits were witnessed between top giants on this playing field, user friendliness had much more of a presence, and was even the primary focus and goal for software and hardware product developers, however keeping in mind ease of use of a product escaped the buildings and minds of developers, who are unfortunately now so focused on exclusivity that no products work universally, like they used to in tech world, back when users were much happier in front of their computers. Today we see widespread frustration, and rare immediate success with trying to do something like send a file in an email that doesn’t involve hours of ridiculous rigmarole, or just to try to review your own file that you already have on your computer so why on Earth would you want to download it again when opening it in Google Drive or any other cloud service? I know that the answer is to force a user then to enlist the uses of affiliates or that company’s other products and that lack of concern or even admittance to this strategy seems to be ever absent, while ignoring or disregarding users overall feelings of frustration, dissatisfaction, and unwillingness to go forward using anything from them, has largely become standard operating procedure. Consumers have the responsibility of rejecting this tactic and refusing to purchase and use products and company services as they continue with these practices, otherwise we give permission and allow corporate giants and other companies that will follow, to own and hold our personal information and to dictate how and when we can access this information belonging to us. This is basically personal information extortion and laws need to get current in preventing these ethically low standard practices as they do not benefit their users and are clearly no longer designed with us in mind.",1,0,2.18.172.02.35,2020-06-19 06:35:40,,
