Not sure why it's now alerting me to use a PC for operational use. I've only ever used this app with an Android mobile, had no issues, though it's been a long time since using this service. Stopped using this app when I started getting continuing notifications for a ""one - time - activation - fee"" payment is required, then automatically redirected to a account activation page for immediate payment processing. Then again, application software & systems do evolve. (Below I could be totally wrong, there maybe, more than likely these days, unknown compatibility issues with all the different browsers & abilities of different search engines, originally designed for PC's, now modified for various OS' s, like the multitude of Android versions still supported. In my case, Android Mobile once supported, doesn't seem to be anymore. My financial rumblings: (Practical assumptions) Revenue Creation - Cost Reduction? - Perhaps - Maybe - or - Implementation from given app features to Chargeable Useability Services? How - by focussing on universally recognized platforms that support multiple device (format & system) types. e.g. OS-10, available for all formats from PDA & Wearable to Portable devices & PC station systems. From personal use to commercial use, (Secure Data Handling & Cloud Server Operations etc). By only allowing usage access to user devices licensed with retail or commercially purchased OS's allows Commencement from non-billable application features(given) to be reclassified as billable services(option). [Requirements having been met & no licensing agreements breached.] This now negates the app's ""free usage conditions"" in the OPEN-SOURCE LICENCE AGREEMENT('s) for Android OS' s. Thus, now allowing flexible user fees for, account, access, usage, storage, etc.., along with Automatic activation of account billing for fees & services that can be processed for payment without notification. (If valid creditcard details are listed in your user account) Authorization for automatic billing was, most likely, already approved by you, in advance, via the - user registration, account creation, software, usage & purchase agreement('s) or most commonly, (by installing this software you agree to the user agreement) Read User Agreement, at least once, for reference.",4,0,2.18.232.03.34,2021-01-07 22:00:50,,
